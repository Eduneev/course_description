V2L courses enjoy a finely granulated hierarchy organised by Units, Sections, Topics, Video Learning Modules (VLM) and Concept Learning Outcomes (CLO).

A CLO is a statement of what a student should expect to recall, solve or perform upon its completion.

Course Faculty carry several years of teaching and industry experience. The lessons are taught systematically, and delivered in simple, lucid language and manner. Courses are designed to inculcate a clear understanding of subject-concepts and enable students to gain theoretical and practical insights.
